Difference between static coding and dynamic structures (we want data structures)’ Dictionaries are dynamic structures Try Except Fail - tries to open files

# TPT 0.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing

Drones Good and bad May violate privacy, but useful for search and rescue, photography, etc. Dopamine - Gaming, social media, instagram, youtube gets in the way of life Phone trees - saves money, reduces hold time, but may be inaccurate Can be represented with code: if statements, sequencing, and procedures Come up with 3 beneficial and harmful effects of computing. Then talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Anything impacting success?

Action Instagram algorithms collect data about your preferences, creating a customized profile suited to your tastes However, this could be harmful because it could cause privacy concerns Phones and texting help us communicate when we’re far away from each other However, reliance on this form of communication breaks down personal interaction We’ve come to depend on things like Wifi, internet access, and online services, which help us in our daily lives However, we have become overly reliant on them and become lazy

# TPT 0.2 Digital Divide 
Have or don’t have in relation to computers, internet, and technology Poorer, rural areas might have less access to technology, or some countries have restricted internet access Contributing factors: socioeconomic, geographic, demographic Action Answer the following How does someone empower themselves in a digital world? We can use digital technology like the internet by finding resources to help them with education or finding career opportunities How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? People with access to resources should share them with those who have little access to computers and technology. Ex: if you’re replacing your old laptop with a new one, donate the old one to someone who needs it. Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS The school already hands out chromebooks to students who don’t have a computer. However, a lot of divide exists because some students aren’t familiar with technical and/or social media, and helping students move onto these platforms can increase connectivity and communication. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte Any form of restricting access to technology is not digital empowerment. One example is the PUSD wifi, which isn’t great and lots of websites are restricted. Websites that would greatly benefit students’ learnings are prohibited.

TT1
- Lists and dictionaries are collection data structures (hold multiple values)
- CRUD: user defines table as a class
  - A list is a class structure
  - Ex: infoDb = [] is an object of class list
  - Classes: attributes and methods (functions)
    - Methods apply to all objects
    - Call method with a dot method
    - Ex: infoDb.append(--{insert dictionary w/ key value paris}--)
Try to print info from lists using for, while loop
While uses boolean condition
For takes care of the counter by itself, don’t need to add 1 (increment) each time
Factorials can use recursion
In a while loop, need exit condition
  - Ex: n = 1 or n = 0, return 1
For fibonacci challenge, use try except (can’t use negative numbers in fibonacci)

# 5.3 Computer Bias
5.3 Computer Bias
Computer algorithms and programs may have unintentional bias, possibly due to the data they collect that is unrepresentative of different genders, races etc.
- HP computer facial recognition software
Computer bias is sometimes beneficial, ex targeted ads
Watch the video... HP computers are racist
Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
- Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
  - Yes, it seems the owner thinks this was intentional racism by HP computers.
- If yes or no, justify your conclusion.
  - The owner openly stated that he thinks HP computers are racist. However, this is probably unintentional computing bias.
- How do you think this happened?
  - When HP was testing their computers, they probably took data from a group of individuals who weren’t representative of everyone. It was probably unintentional, and their data set probably was mostly light skinned people.
- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
  - This may be harmful because it excludes darker skinned people but it wasn’t intentional. It just so happened that they overlooked how their data set was not representative.
- Should it be corrected?
  - Yes, in cases of computing bias that adversely and unintentionally affects certain groups, the bias should be corrected.
- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
  - In order to avoid this bias, you should find representative data samples when developing computer programs that represent the wider population who will use your software.

# 5.4 Crowdsourcing
- Way to reduce bias in computing
- Example: Wikipedia: often inaccurate, but often corrected through self-policing
- Data samples must be representative of larger population
- Actions
  - CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
    - One crowdsource idea is that we could collect data about what CSP students think would be the best way to learn computer science. This would be like the surveys done by AP statistics students. We could then learn from this feedback and adjust the CSP curriculum by, for example, changing the focus from PBL to a more traditional learning style if students struggle with the former.
  - What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
    - Del crowd sourcing is regularly done with AP Stats student surveys and the regular DNN videos in which some students go around interviewing people on campus. My final project could be better with crowdsourcing because I could be getting feedback about my program from Del Norte students.

# TPT 0.2 Digital Divide 
Have or don’t have in relation to computers, internet, and technology Poorer, rural areas might have less access to technology, or some countries have restricted internet access Contributing factors: socioeconomic, geographic, demographic Action Answer the following How does someone empower themselves in a digital world? We can use digital technology like the internet by finding resources to help them with education or finding career opportunities How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? People with access to resources should share them with those who have little access to computers and technology. Ex: if you’re replacing your old laptop with a new one, donate the old one to someone who needs it. Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS The school already hands out chromebooks to students who don’t have a computer. However, a lot of divide exists because some students aren’t familiar with technical and/or social media, and helping students move onto these platforms can increase connectivity and communication. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte Any form of restricting access to technology is not digital empowerment. One example is the PUSD wifi, which isn’t great and lots of websites are restricted. Websites that would greatly benefit students’ learnings are prohibited.
